This project presents a real-time facial and emotion recognition system using Haar Cascade for face detection and KLT(Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) algorithm for feature tracking . The system detects emotions such as sadness and fear from facial expressions, using a camera module integrated with an Arduino microcontroller. When these emotions are identified, the Arduino triggers an emergency alert system via Bluetooth, sending an emergency message to predefined contacts for immediate response. The system enhances user safety by providing real-time emotional monitoring, leveraging deep learning for accuracy and Arduino-Bluetooth integration for rapid communication, offering potential applications in mental health monitoring and security systems.
